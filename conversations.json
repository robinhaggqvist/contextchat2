Initially, the AI confirmed the mic was working well when the user stated \"the magic number is 55.\" Later, the user performed another test, speaking both Thai and English, which the AI struggled to understand clearly in Thai but confirmed \"working\" in English.\n2.  **Magic Number:**\n    *   Initially, the user stated the magic number was **55**, and the AI confirmed it heard this.\n    *   Later, when asked, the AI did not recall any magic number.\n    *   The user then mistakenly provided \"fish four\" as the magic number, which the AI acknowledged.\n    *   The user corrected this to **54**. The AI apologized for the misunderstanding and updated its memory to 54.\n    *   Finally, the AI confirmed the magic number as **54** based on the last correction.",
